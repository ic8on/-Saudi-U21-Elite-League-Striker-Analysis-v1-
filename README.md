## 📌 Project Overview This is an independent football data analysis project focused on analyzing strikers in the Saudi U21 Elite League.  The project was built out of personal interest and curiosity about football analytics, and to explore early attacking indicators in a newly established competition.
## 📊 Dataset
- Competition: Saudi U21 Elite League
- Matches analyzed: 12 matches
- Season: Current season (First edition of the league)
- Data source: Publicly available match information

Each row in the dataset represents a single goal event.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Focus
Due to limited data availability, the analysis focuses on:
- Total goals scored
- Matches with goals (consistency)
- Goal timing (early / late goals)
- Multi-goal matches

Advanced metrics such as minutes played or goals per 90 were not used.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- The league is newly established
- Data sources are limited and incomplete
- No official minutes played or starter/substitute data
- Analysis represents early indicators, not final evaluations

---

## 👀 Players to Watch
Based on early indicators, several strikers were identified for continued monitoring
throughout the season.

These observations will be updated as more data becomes available.

---

## 🔄 Future Updates
- Update the dataset as more matches are played
- Improve analysis with additional metrics if available
- Release v2 at the end of the season

---

## 🧠 Disclaimer
This project is an exploratory analysis and should not be considered
a definitive scouting or performance evaluation.
